# Quiz React WebApp

Created an Quiz app using ReactJs. Used Open Trivia DataBase API for fetching the questions. The Quiz will allow user to select number of questions, user can select from amoung various categories and user can select level of difficulty from easy, medium and hard.  

After entering all the details the quiz is started where user gets 30 seconds to answer an question. After attempting all the questions a final result will be displayed and two buttons for resetting the quiz and go back to home.  

Used React Hooks and Routes in this app for states and routing between pages.
